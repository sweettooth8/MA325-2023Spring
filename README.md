1.4 Calculators
Calculators are not allowed for exams or quizzes unless permitted.
2 Course Structure
2.1 Assignments
Homework will be collected in class. The homework due in any given week is the homework
corresponding to the material of the previous week. No late assignments will be
accepted. Best 7 (out of 8)scores are counted for credit. Two course projects will be
assigned, which should be implemented by MATLAB.
Homework must be readable and should be stapled. Illegible scribblings will receive
no credit from the grader. You are encouraged to attempt all the questions and discuss
with your classmates. However, the write-up must be of your own.

2.2 Quizzes
Basically, you will have a short in-class quiz every three weeks, 4 times in total. It usually
takes 30 minutes, which only requires you to understand concepts and basic problem
solving skills. No makeups will be made for quizzes. Only best 3 scores are counted
for credit, which means you can miss one quiz or do poorly on one quiz.
2.3 Midterm
One midterm is planned for Thursday, Apr. 6, tentatively. Makeups may be given in
extraordinary cases, but only with documented reasons.
2.4 Final Exam
The Final Exam will be given during the Final Exam Week.
The location and date of the final will be announced in class.
2.5 Course Grade
Your course grade will be determined using the following distributions:
Quizzes 15% (5% for each)
HW 21% (20%+1%(bonus), 3% for each)
Projects 10% (5% for each)
Midterm 20%
Final 35%
